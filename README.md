## Descriptio 

Solitaire implemented by scratch on vue.js. It contains 3 types of solitaire namely spider(which was made famous by
microsoft back when I was a kid) ,spider 4 suit and klondike. I've learned web development myself without any course or coaching so don't expect too
much from the source code xD. 

## About the project 
eventlisteners on the Card.vue component. - Libraries like Vue.draggable were not used as i had to write most of the drag and drop logic according to
the solitaire game type and I also had to **MOVE** the stack of cards. - Ghost image in drag is removed instead the **whole stack** of card moves with
cursor change. ### CSS - Each and every card is 100% css except the SVG of the suit in the center of the card,which is made by illustrator tool. ### 3
mode menu Choose from 3 variants of solitaire form the main menu # Variants ## **Klondike** ## **Spider 4 Suit** ## **Spider 1 Suit** 

## Project setup
``` npm install npm start ```
